DESCRIPTION
  This small utility looks for the coretemp chip on your machine and prints out 
  the physical chip temperature (hopefully). It usues the lm-sensors library
  to fetch temperature data and is based on the 'sensors' program. The aim for
  now is to generate traces as the cpu temperature changes and correlate it with
  increasing workload

DEPENDENCIES
  Requires the following packages 

  For Fedora : 
    1. lm_sensors-devel
    2. lm_sensors-lib
    3. lm_sensors

  For Ubuntu : 
    1. lm-sensors
    2. lm-sensors-dev

  Also requires workload-kit, lttng and its dependencies

HOWTO
  Before running application do the following first : 
  
  $sensors-detect 

  You can then run 'wk-temp -h' for detailed usage

NOTES
  * Compile without Workload Kit:
    gcc -g cputemp_tp.c cputemp.c -I./ -lsensors -o coretemp -llttng-ust -ldl

TODO
  * Generate trace only when temp changes and not everytime when print_chip()
    is called
  * Also maybe find a way to adaptively increase samples and repeat times 
    as heating increases
